# matplotlib-challenge

This repo uses a Jupyter notebook with Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to analyze data from a recent animal study. In the study, 249 mice who were identified with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The dataset consists of two csv files with mouse metadata and study results. 

The ***pymaceuticals.ipynb*** Jupyter notebook file is located in the **Pymaceuticals** folder.

The ***Mouse_metadata.csv*** and ***Study_results.csv*** files are located in the **Pymaceuticals/data** subfolder.

The analysis consists of the following:

- Data prep
- Summary statistics
- Bar charts and pie charts
- Calculation of quartiles, identification of outliers, and box plot
- Line plot and scatter plot
- Correlation and Regression
